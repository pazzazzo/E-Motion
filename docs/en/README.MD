# E-Motion Project

E-Motion is an ambitious project aimed at designing a custom dashboard that integrates cutting-edge technologies. Built to deliver an enjoyable and innovative driving experience, the E-Motion dashboard combines advanced tech, performance, and sleek design.

## Objective

The primary goal of the E-Motion project is to create a dynamic and safe driving experience. The dashboard will be equipped with advanced technologies to enhance safety, connectivity, and comfort for both the driver and passengers.

## Key Features

* **High-Performance Services:** The dashboard leverages well-known, high-performance services such as Electron for software development, Waze for user alerts, Mapbox for dynamic and modern map rendering, and Spotify for music playback and passenger access to playlists.
* **15â€³ Touchscreen:** The software is currently designed for a 15â€³ touch display.
* **Monitoring System:** Integrated sensors will monitor driving in real time with both interior and exterior dashcams, as well as a rear-view camera.
* **Advanced Connectivity:** The vehicle will feature Bluetooth and Internet connectivity for music streaming (Spotify or local), hands-free calling, and communication with other mobile devices.
* **CAN Bus Access:** The dashboard will connect to the vehicleâ€™s OBD-II port (on-board diagnostics) for direct access to vehicle information such as speed, fuel level, door status, etc.

## Core Components

The E-Motion project will use a variety of key components, including:

* **Jetson Nano:** A powerful compute board like the Jetson Nano will serve as the main computer to render the dashboard smoothly.
* **Cameras & Sensors:** Cameras and sensors will be used for obstacle detection, environmental monitoring, and additional applications.

## Vehicle Interior

In addition to software functionality, the vehicleâ€™s interior will include:

* **USB-C Ports:** Integrated USB-C ports for charging electronic devices, offering extra convenience for passengers.
* **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor:** A rear-mounted ultrasonic sensor will detect distance to obstacles during reverse maneuvers.
* **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Wi-Fi access for features such as camera feeds when the vehicle is parked and real-time vehicle location.
* **Stereo Amplifier:** The Jetson Nano will connect to a stereo amplifier for high-quality in-vehicle audio.
* **High-Quality Microphone:** A quality microphone will be installed for hands-free calls and other communication functions.

### Dashboard Specifications

* **Screen Size:** 15 inches
* **Resolution:** 1366Ã—768 pixels
* **Frameworks Used:** Electron JS, Waze, Spotify, Mapbox, Google TTS, Google Maps, Chart.js, Wit.AI, etc.

### Main Functionalities

1. **Voice AI:** An AI powered by Wit.AI enables easy place searches and music control.
2. **Vehicle Data Display:** The dashboard shows vital vehicle informationâ€”speed, engine temperature, fuel level, etc.â€”in real time.
3. **Controls & Management:** Users can interact with various apps such as Spotify, YouTube, Camera, and more.
4. **Intuitive Navigation:** The user interface is designed to be friendly and intuitive, providing smooth navigation.

### Dependencies

The application has several dependencies, including `Node.js`, `libbluetooth-dev`, etc. To install them, run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Running Tests

Simple unit tests are provided using **Jest** to verify some utility functions. To run them:

```bash
npm run test
```
